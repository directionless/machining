# Intro #

There's a tiny shear pin holding the lead screw to the drive motor.

# Diagram and measurements #

It looks like a T:


      ->|                          |<- 0.188"

       	----------------------------
	|			   |

	----------|    	 |----------  ---

		  --------            ---
			  
                ->|      |<- 0.058"


# Replacements #

There's a bunch of discussion about how one should be careful about
how this is a *shear* pin and not a key. So one should not exceed the
original shear specs. It might have originally been brass. Apparently
people have used 0.091" brass rods from Ace Hardware? Or 3/32 bronze
brazing rods

At least one guy's notes
(http://www.gadgetbuilder.com/Rockwell/Rockwell.html) say this about
replacing the shear pin

    The leadscrew has a shear pin on the left end to reduce the chance
    of damage from a crash while threading or auto feeding. A section
    of a finish nail had been substituted so I turned a replacement
    shear pin from mild steel per the plans in the manual. I thought
    this was a nifty way for the Rockwell factory to ensure that
    replacement shear pins are always easily available.
