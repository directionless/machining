# Intro #

This lathe came with a Jacobs Rubber Flex System. It was pretty
misaligned, and had a lot of visible wobble when the lathe was
running. Perhaps something was dropped on it.

The Jacobs Rubber Flex stuff was introduced as a high end collet
system. It sold for between $3,000 and $10,000. These days, you can
buy them for about $100-$300 on ebay. Some people seem to like them,
with a couple of caveats:

  * Really more for finishing work
  * They have less clamping force, so it's not for heavy work
  * work surface can matter
  * you can't clamp short things. The workpiece must extend through most of the collet, or you can use a plug.

I found manuals for a slightly different version, and put them in the
manuals directory.

# Alignment #

The chuck is held to a back plate with 6 bolts. The normal alignment
mechanism is to fiddle with a hammer and an indicator. I found a
couple people's descriptions of this:

    Mine is middle-of-the-road, and a smoke test with an indicator
    typically showed .001" to .002" TIR on clean stock just in front of
    the collet. The manual says to adjust TIR by loosening the spindle
    mount and banging the chuck body toward zero TIR while tightening the
    spindle mount.

and 

    But that's not all... Tighten the L00 nut with 4 or 5 solid hammer
    blows to the spanner wrench engaged to the L00 draw nut. (OK that's
    standard procedure)

    Then indicate the chuck cone ( thats the taper that the collet
    jaws are pushed down into to force them close. This is done with
    the collet out of the cone) with a tenths indicator.

    Then tap the L00 draw nut at a point axially in line with the high
    spot of the runout.

    Ok then they show a pic of a guy whacking on the side of the L00
    nut.

    "Till the desired degree of accuracy is obtained."
