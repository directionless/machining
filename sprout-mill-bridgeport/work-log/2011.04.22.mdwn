After a long absence, finally getting back to this.

One of the big impediments to work was the time that went into getting
everything setup for testing and then torn back down for storage. It
was probably about 30 minutes on each side. And when I only have a
couple hours a week, that's pretty significant.

So, tonight, I started addressing that. There's now a shelf near the
mill for the computer to live on. And more parts towards making proper
electronics boxes and cables and the like. 

This feels like real progress.

There was also bonus lathe work. Found the problem in the drive
assembly that was making it go whumpa whumpa -- it was missing a set
screw. Also found the problem in the chuck -- the clamp part was
misaligned to the backing plate. Not entirely sure how the chuck is
supposed to work, the design is kinda dumb.
